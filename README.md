# atbash_cipher
a simple python implementation of the Atbash Cipher that encrypts and decrypts messages by reversing the alphabet
[test_atbash.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22641675/test_atbash.py)
For example, A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, C ↔ X, and so on.

This program:
- Accepts plaintext input from the user
- Encrypts and decrypts the text using the Atbash cipher logic
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters like spaces and punctuation

To run the program, use:


python atbash_cipher.py
